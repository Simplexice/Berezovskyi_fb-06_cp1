Task:
Write programs to calculate the frequencies of letters and frequencies of bigrams in the text, 
as well as to calculate H1 and H2 by direct definition. Calculate the frequencies of letters and bigrams, 
as well as the values of H1 and H2 on an arbitrarily chosen text in Russian of sufficient length (at least 1 MB) ,
where the probabilities are replaced by the corresponding frequencies. Also get the values of H1 and H2 on the same text, 
in which all spaces are removed.
